\" Indian Politics is a complex and diverse system that encompasses a range of political ideologies, parties, and interests, with the potential to significantly impact the nation's social, economic, and geopolitical landscape.

Political parties play a crucial role in shaping the nation's policies and governance, with the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party being two of the most prominent political parties in the country.
